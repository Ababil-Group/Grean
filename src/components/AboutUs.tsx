        <p className="leading-8 text-white">
          We don’t sell fertilizers, lime, or chemicals. It’s not part of our
          business model, and it never will be.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8 text-white">
          We’re not answerable to any external entity that doesn’t prioritize
          the farmer’s best interests. As a true partner in agriculture, Grean
          remains completely independent.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8 text-white">
          We don’t add unnecessary substances to the soil. We only introduce
          nutrients and soil enhancers when there’s a clear deficiency that
          needs addressing.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8 text-white">
          We don’t make assumptions. All our advice is rooted in precise,
          scientifically gathered data, carefully analyzed to determine the best
          course of action for each unique situation.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-8 text-white">
          We never work in isolation. Collaboration is key. The farmer is at the
          heart of everything we do, and their active involvement in the process
          is vital to our mutual success. This partnership is one of the main
          reasons we are passionate about what we do.
